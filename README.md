## Note-Taker

# Usage
This program is a note creator application that allows users to easily and quickly save their ideas locally. This application is one of my first attempts at combining front end with the starting frameworks of backend coding. The app pushed me to explore express require comands, and their important usage in talking to front end code. Although simple, creating a functional work pad allowed me to see both the wide ability scope of servers, and how they can be used for very useful applications. 

# installation

# Usage
This application has three abilities, creating notes, saving notes, and deleting notes.
